# Drone Pets Newsletter Signup Site

This project was created by Patrick Fergurson, Vincent Choi, and Jeffrey Fazal over the course of two days. The goal of the project was to create a site that would demonstrate to users how an accessible and easy-to-use site can be made for newsletter signups. The theme of the site is drone pets.
Overview

The Drone Pets Newsletter Signup Site is a single-page site that allows users to sign up for a newsletter related to drone pets. The site is designed to be easy to use and accessible to all users, regardless of their level of technical expertise or physical abilities.

The site includes a simple form that users can fill out to sign up for the newsletter. The form includes fields for the user's name and email address. The form is designed to be easy to use and accessible to all users, including those who may use screen readers or other assistive technologies.
Technology Used

The Drone Pets Newsletter Signup Site was created using React and the Material-UI library. The site was built using the Bootstrap framework, which allowed us to create a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
